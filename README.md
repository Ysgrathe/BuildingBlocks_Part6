#  Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 6
> This repository supports the YouTube video [Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 6](https://www.youtube.com/).  

That video is part 6 in a series aimed at giving people who want to use C++ with the Unreal Engine a helping hand to get started.
In this part, we take our project even further, adding UI elements.
