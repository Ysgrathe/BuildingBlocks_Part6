#  Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 4
> This repository supports the YouTube video [Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/).  

That video is part 4 in a series aimed at giving people who want to use C++ with the Unreal Engine a helping hand to get started.
In this part, we build on the basic project we made in the last video, working with our PlayerController class,
setting it up to use the Enhanced Input framework.
